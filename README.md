Automated Report Generation Project


The Automated Report Generation project involves developing a Python script that processes data from a file, analyzes it, and generates a formatted PDF report. This report provides insights into the data and presents it in a professional, easy-to-read format. The script uses libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab to create the PDF, offering full control over the document's layout, styling, and content.

Objectives

Data Extraction and Analysis: The script extracts data from a provided file (e.g., CSV, Excel) and processes it for analysis. The analysis could involve generating statistics, summaries, or insights based on the data.

PDF Report Generation: Using Python libraries like FPDF or ReportLab, the project aims to automate the creation of a formatted PDF report. The report includes sections like title, introduction, data analysis, tables, and visualizations (if applicable).

Customization: The script offers customization options to modify the reportâ€™s layout, font styles, colors, and other design elements, ensuring a professional appearance.


Deliverables

Python Script: A script that processes the data and generates a formatted PDF report.

Sample Report: A sample PDF report showcasing the script's functionality and how the generated report would appear with actual data.


Technologies Used

Python

FPDF / ReportLab (for PDF generation)

Pandas (for data processing)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional, for data visualizations)
